Extraction in csv file format, of some of the Fallout 76 releases Plans and Recipes available in game.
When a new game season arrives, I will update this repo.

You will notice some plans or recipes where the internal naming scheme begins with 'zzz_<plan_name>' or 'zzz_<recipe_name>'.
Those are disabled plans in the game, and aren't available to claim.
